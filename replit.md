# AI-Powered Order Management System for Plastic Bag Manufacturing

## Overview

This project is an advanced AI-powered order management system designed to enhance operational efficiency in plastic bag manufacturing through intelligent data processing, real-time tracking, and multilingual interfaces. Its primary purpose is to streamline manufacturing processes, improve decision-making, and provide a robust, user-friendly platform. Key capabilities include comprehensive order and production management, AI-powered analytics and predictions, quality control, maintenance tracking, and HR management.

## User Preferences

- Language: Arabic (RTL) with English fallback
- Error handling: User-friendly messages in Arabic
- Logging: Comprehensive server-side logging for debugging
- Code style: Consistent TypeScript with proper type safety

## System Architecture

The system is built with a modern stack emphasizing efficiency and scalability.

-   **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite, TanStack Query, utilizing Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components for a responsive and intuitive user interface. UI/UX decisions prioritize Arabic RTL design principles.
-   **Backend**: Node.js and Express, providing robust API endpoints.
-   **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon Serverless) managed with Drizzle ORM, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval.
-   **AI Features**: Integration with OpenAI for advanced analytics and machine learning capabilities, including predictive analysis.
-   **Core Features**:
    -   Multilingual support (Arabic/English).
    -   Real-time order tracking and management.
    -   Voice recognition and synthesis.
    -   Advanced production order management, including detailed product specifications and production notes.
    -   **Three-Machine Roll Tracking**: Each roll is now tracked with three separate machines (film/extruder, printing, cutting) throughout its production lifecycle, replacing the single-machine tracking system.
    -   **Enhanced Roll Labels**: 4x6 inch roll labels now display comprehensive information including machine assignments, raw materials, color, punching type, and operator names for all three production stages.
    -   Quality control systems.
    -   Maintenance tracking, including spare parts management.
    -   HR management with attendance tracking and training programs.
-   **System Design**: Features role-based access control, comprehensive order and production management, real-time inventory and warehouse tracking, and integrated quality/maintenance monitoring.
-   **Error Handling Strategy**: Implemented with global error boundaries on the frontend, comprehensive error logging and graceful responses on the API, transaction safety and connection resilience for the database, and intelligent retry with exponential backoff for network operations.
-   **Technical Implementations**: Includes a comprehensive number formatting system, sequential ID generation for various entities, and integrated attendance and notification systems.

## External Dependencies

-   **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon Serverless)
-   **AI/ML**: OpenAI
-   **Messaging**: Twilio (for WhatsApp notifications)

## Recent Changes

### Roll Production Workflow Enhancement (October 28, 2025)

#### Phase 1: Staged Machine Assignment
- **Database Schema**: Updated `rolls` table to track three separate machines (`film_machine_id`, `printing_machine_id`, `cutting_machine_id`) with staged assignment
  - `printing_machine_id` and `cutting_machine_id` are now nullable, assigned during their respective production stages
- **Roll Creation**: Modified to only require film machine selection at creation time
  - Printing and cutting machines assigned later in their respective stages
  - Backend validation ensures only film machine is active at roll creation
- **Labels**: Enhanced 4x6 inch roll labels to display all three machine assignments, product specifications, and operator names

#### Phase 2: Printing Stage Machine Selection (October 28, 2025)
- **Frontend**: Added modal dialog in printing queue for machine selection
  - Users must select a printing machine before marking roll as printed
  - Machines filtered by printing section and active status
- **Backend**: Updated `/api/rolls/:id/print` endpoint to accept and validate `printing_machine_id`
  - Validates machine exists and is active before assigning
- **Storage**: Enhanced `markRollPrinted` function to save printing machine assignment
  - Updates `printing_machine_id` field when roll moves to printing stage

### AI Assistant Major Enhancement (October 29, 2025)

#### Comprehensive AI Assistant Upgrade
- **Context-Aware Intelligence**: AI assistant now receives real-time system context (production stats, machine status, active orders) for more accurate and relevant responses
- **Improved Intent Analysis**: Enhanced natural language understanding with better intent detection for queries, reports, and database operations
- **Security Improvements**: 
  - Replaced direct SQL generation with safe storage layer access
  - Fixed `require()` to use async `import()` for ES modules compatibility
  - All database operations now go through validated storage interface
- **Enhanced User Interface**:
  - Added typing indicator with animation ("جاري التفكير...")
  - Improved message display with better styling
  - Updated quick action buttons with practical queries
  - Better loading states and error handling
- **Performance Optimizations**:
  - Optimized data queries using existing storage methods
  - Better error messages in Arabic for users
  - Improved response formatting and readability
- **Smart Query Handling**: AI now intelligently gathers relevant data (customers, orders, machines, rolls, production stats) based on question context before responding
- **Enhanced Data Processing**: 
  - Added direct counters (customersCount, ordersCount, machinesCount, etc.) for faster responses
  - Improved prompt engineering for more accurate AI interpretations
  - Better handling of plural forms in Arabic queries

### Film Stage Production Queue Enhancement (October 29, 2025)

#### Production Order Visibility Improvement
- **Film Queue Logic**: Modified `getFilmQueue()` to keep production orders visible until full quantity is produced
  - Orders now remain in film stage queue while `produced_quantity_kg < final_quantity_kg`
  - Previously, orders could disappear before reaching target quantity
  - Ensures operators can continue creating rolls until production is complete
- **Database Query**: Enhanced query to compare actual roll weights against `final_quantity_kg` threshold
  - Added `final_quantity_kg` to SELECT fields for visibility
  - Implemented WHERE condition checking remaining production capacity
  - Maintains performance with indexed queries
